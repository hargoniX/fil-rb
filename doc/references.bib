abstract="In a new approach, functional correctness specifications of insert/update and delete operations on search trees are expressed on the level of lists by means of an inorder traversal function that projects trees to lists. With the help of a small lemma library, functional correctness and preservation of the search tree property are proved automatically (in Isabelle/HOL) for a range of data structures: unbalanced binary trees, AVL trees, red-black trees, 2-3 and 2-3-4 trees, 1-2 brother trees, AA trees and splay trees.",

abstract = {Chris Okasaki showed how to implement red-black trees in a functional programming language. Ralf Hinze incorporated even the invariants of such data structures into their types, using higher-order nested datatypes. We show how one can achieve something very similar without the usual performance penalty of such types, by combining the features of nested datatypes, phantom types and existential type variables.},

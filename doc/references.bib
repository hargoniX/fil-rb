abstract="In a new approach, functional correctness specifications of insert/update and delete operations on search trees are expressed on the level of lists by means of an inorder traversal function that projects trees to lists. With the help of a small lemma library, functional correctness and preservation of the search tree property are proved automatically (in Isabelle/HOL) for a range of data structures: unbalanced binary trees, AVL trees, red-black trees, 2-3 and 2-3-4 trees, 1-2 brother trees, AA trees and splay trees.",
